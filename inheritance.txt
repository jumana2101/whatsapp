 Inheritance
============
   
     We can access one class methods to another class by using  "extends" Keyword.


Why we go for inheritance?
==========================

     1) to reduce the memory wastage 

Syntax
======
    public class child classname extends parent classname


Types of inheritance 
====================

1) Single inheritance    
2) Multiple inheritance
3) Multilevel inheritance
4) Hierarchical inheritance
5) Hybrid inheritance 


1)Single inheritance
 ===================

 Combinations of one parent class and one child class

2)Multiple inheritance
 =====================

   More than one parent class access the child class parallelly at a time.

    Note : Multiple inheritance is not possible in java by using extends.

    Reasons
    =======
    1)Priority problem
    2)Syntax error (By using extends keyword we can't access two class parallelly) 

3) Multilevel inheritance
  ========================

  More than one parent accessing the child class in a tree level structure.                  

4)Hierarchical inheritance
 =========================

    Combination of one parent class and more than one child class.

5)Hybrid inheritance
 ===================
  
   Combination of single and mutliple inheritance.
